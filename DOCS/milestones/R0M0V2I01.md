# Milestone R0M0V2I01

Date: 2026-02-23  
Track: `R0M0V2I01` (`I` = `INTERNAL`)

## Scope Summary

- Release marker bump to `R0M0V2I01` in runtime/banner/docs.
- LED Timer1 pattern set expanded and tuned:
  - `I T0 0` off
  - `I T0 1` normal toggle
  - `I T0 7` fast double-pulse
  - `I T0 F` inverted on/off timing
  - `I T0 8` nibble wig-wag (`PB0-3` vs `PB4-7`)
- Boot banner enhancements:
  - Dynamic computed code/data size line (`code/data`).
  - Runtime checksum line for `$8000-$FFFF`.
  - Checksum upgraded to 32-bit straight-add.
  - Banner dynamic lines centered/aligned to match the 3-line frame.
- Interrupt/debug behavior:
  - NMI behavior adjusted to break into monitor/debug path during monitor activity.
  - Register-preservation hardening for banner/checksum helper ABI.

## Technical Notes

- Checksum is computed at runtime over inclusive ROM range `$8000..$FFFF`.
- 32-bit checksum path is split into smaller helpers in `SRC/bso2.asm` for easier migration into `SRC/lib.asm`:
  - clear accumulator
  - add byte into 32-bit accumulator
  - pointer increment
  - 32-bit hex print
